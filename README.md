## What's the Artbase Slug?

Using the Artbase Slug for a (pixel) art collection
lets your download all images, metadata, & much more.

Use the artbase_slug e.g. 'goblintown' to
lookup ready-to-use artbase configurations / setups in
the "built-in" artbase index / registry (also known as [artbase/collections.csv](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase/blob/master/collections.csv)).
