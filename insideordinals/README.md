Fast forward to February 2023  - What's Ordinal Theory?

Let's welcome 100 Ordinal Punks (24×24)
"inscribed" into the Bitcoin (BTC) Blockchain!

![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/ordinals.sandbox/raw/master/i/ordinalpunks.png)


- ~$25 Inscription Fee/Punk
- ~$250 Price/Punk (0.01 BTC) To Buy
- (Minimum) Floor Price A Week Later - +$100 000

Three out of five "Top Sellers" ever are Ordinal Punks.
Highest is Ordinal Punk No.  w/ 11.5 BTC (~US$ 270 000) on February 10th, 2023
and Ordinal Punk No.  w/ 9.5 BTC (~US$ 220 000) on February 8th, 2023.

So what? Do I care?

The official blurb on the Ordinal Punks
website - [ordinalpunks.com](https://ordinalpunks.com/) - reads:


>  [...]
>
>  Ordinal Punks are using [**an open source algorithm**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead) to generate
>  the profile picture (pfp) which is 192x192 pixels.
>
>  [...]


Guess what?

Yes, the "open source algorithm"
is the (crypto) punk's not dead punk text-to-image generator.

- Bitcoin is the new gold
- Bitcoin is the new gold standard (and the best store of value and world reserve)
- Bitcoin is the new internet (of value / money)
- Bitcoin proof-of-work / waste hashing is creating "intrinsic" value
- Bitcoin proof-of-work / waste hashing power is a measure of the strength of the network
- Bitcoin mining is free (the coinbase block rewards are freebies)
- Bitcoin mining is the beginning of a renewable energy revolution
- Bitcoin HODLing creates wealth
- Bitcoin is a singularity - no copies ever possible (or accepted) - Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision (BSV) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) is NOT Bitcoin (BTC) and is NOT Bitcoin Cash (BCH)...
- Bitcoin is the beginning of a new era of world peace
- Bitcoin makes wars impossible - no more buying weapons with inflated national money or on public credit
- Bitcoin is the beginning of a new era of a trust-less "honest" banking and decentralized austrian finance utopia - no scams, no wash trading, no money laundering, no ponzis, no million dollar banker bonuses, no hedge fund speculation, no central banks, ...
- Bitcoin is banking the unbanked poor and unwashed
- And many more lies  (Are You Orange-Pilled Yet?)



Enter Ordinal Theory and Bitcoin Inscriptions


The new Bitcoin "narrative" (starting February 2023):


Yeah, we found a use for Bitcon!  It's a database!

"Ulta-sound"  ~~money~~  .jpegs!
Yes, monkeys, punks, goblins, and more!

"inscribed", that is, written into the bitcoin blockchain, that is, open (shared) public database.


Limitations:   4 MB max. (per block)
and - of course - you have to pay for every byte  (or vbyte) stored
in bitcoin.  Funny money for funny monkeys!

- Bitcon Maxis!
- Small Blockers vs Big Blockers
- Bitcoin Gold vs Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Maxis (and Small Blockers) won the "crypto (bitcon) wars":

Early "investors"  in the pyramid
HODL and enforce ever more limits / restrictions
on transactions and "inscriptions" -
make bitcoin "super-rare" collectibles
and "ultra-sound" money / gold

e.g.
- 2 MB block limit
- 80 byte limit on OP_RETURN "inscriptions"
- and so on

From the Official [Ordinal Theory F.A.Q.](https://docs.ordinals.com/faq.html) written by Casey Rodarmor

**Q: What is ordinal theory?**

A: Ordinal theory is is a protocol for assigning serial numbers to satoshis, the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin, and tracking those satoshis as they are spent by transactions.


Aside - What's a Satoshi?

- 1 bitcoin is 100 million satoshis (1 = 100 000 000 = 10^8)
- 1 euro or 1 dollar is 100 cents (1 = 100 = 10^2)



**Q: Does ordinal theory require a side chain, a separate token, or changes to Bitcoin?**

A: Nope! Ordinal theory works right now, without a side chain, and the only token needed is bitcoin itself.


![](https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchains/raw/master/i/fake-dilbert-blockchain.png)


**Q: What is ordinal theory good for?**

A: Collecting, trading, and scheming. Ordinal theory assigns identities to individual satoshis, allowing them to be individually tracked and traded, as curios and for numismatic value.

Ordinal theory also enables inscriptions, a protocol for attaching arbitrary content to individual satoshis, turning them into bitcoin-native digital artifacts.



Aside - Ordinal Theory Magic Money Miracle:

Before (ordinal theory and "curios"):
- 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi

After:
- 1 satoshi is 11.5 bitcoins (or 1 150 000 000 satoshis) ;-),
  that is, sell your "curio" ordinal
  satoshi for  bitcoins (current all-time record is 11.5 for an ordinal punk).

New protocols built on inscriptions

- sat names  - via json text inscription (first on ??)
  - https://docs.sats.id/sats-names/about
  started by ??????

Sats Names is a standard for writing names to Bitcoin using ordinals.
 The goal is to build a name ecosystem for Bitcoin, that is built by Bitcoiners,
and developed entirely on Bitcoin. We're just starting the process of building
our indexer for this project but we can share our syntax so builders can begin tinkering

The first write of a name on Bitcoin owns the name
For example, the first user to register an ordinal containing "satoshi.sats"
owns that name and the rights to update that name.
With ordinals anyone can write any data they wish, including duplicate names.
This will lead to collisions and competing tribes of name standards.
Bickering over various standards is a waste of our community’s energy.
There is only one neutral, objective pattern for settling collisions; First is first.

There have been 23,926 BRC-20 ordinal inscriptions in the past 24 hours.

It only took 6 weeks for people to figure out how to use ordinals
to make fungible meme coins. At this point, nothing surprises me.

No question about order (numbering)

the transaction is add the blockchain via a new block.

## Appendix / More "Stuff"


###  The Ordinal Punks Fam(ily) Tree




###  Inside Inscriptions  (Opcode Layout / "Envelope")

Inscription content is serialized using data pushes within unexecuted conditionals,
called "envelopes". Envelopes consist of an `OP_FALSE` `OP_IF` ... `OP_ENDIF`
wrapping any number of data pushes.
Because envelopes are effectively no-ops,
they do not change the semantics of the script in which they are included,
and can be combined with any other locking script.

A text inscription containing the string "Hello, world!" is serialized as follows:

```
OP_FALSE
OP_IF
  OP_PUSH "ord"
  OP_1
  OP_PUSH "text/plain;charset=utf-8"
  OP_0
  OP_PUSH "Hello, world!"
OP_ENDIF
```

First the string ord is pushed, to disambiguate inscriptions from other uses of envelopes.

`OP_1` indicates that the next push contains the content type,
and `OP_0` indicates that subsequent data pushes contain the content itself. Multiple data pushes must be used for large inscriptions, as one of taproot's few restrictions is that individual data pushes may not be larger than 520 bytes.
